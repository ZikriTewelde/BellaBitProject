# Fitness Tracker Device Data Analysis: SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project involves comprehensive SQL analysis on a dataset from BellaBit, a wellbeing devices manufacturing company, focusing on user activities, sleep patterns, and their interrelations.

## Key Objectives
- Clean and prepare the dataset by removing blank or zero-value entries.
- Analyze daily user activities and sleep data to uncover patterns.
- Investigate correlations between user activities, steps taken, and sleep quality.

## Data Analysis
- **Daily Activity Analysis**: Includes examining total active minutes, most active days, and overall time tracked.
- **Sleep Data Exploration**: Focuses on sleep duration, quality, and user habits like napping.
- **Joint Analysis**: Combines activity and sleep data to study the impact of daily activities on sleep quality.

## SQL Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Deduplication
- Aggregation and Grouping for detailed insights
- Complex JOIN operations to correlate different dimensions of data
- Creating Views for efficient data visualization and analysis

## Insights and Findings
- Determined average time taken by users to fall asleep.
- Evaluated the prevalence of napping among users.
- Analyzed the optimum sleep duration against actual data.
- Studied the relationship between physical activity, steps taken, and sleep quality.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL Server: For database management and querying.
- Data Visualization Tools (for future integration): Tableau or Power BI.

## Future Scope
- Integration with data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards.
- Expand the analysis to include more dimensions like diet and health metrics.
